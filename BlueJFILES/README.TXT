Rules
    Every turn, you have to do one of five actions.
    
        Fundraise: Raises the amount of money in the money pit and 
        also raises your reputation by a small amount.
        
        Embezzle: Allows you to steal a set amount of money from the 
        money pit and also lowers your reputation by a moderate amount.
        
        Interact: Gives you a chance card with the effect changing your
        reputation and money.
        
        Active: Allows you to use your special ability.  Each player 
        has their own ability with a set cooldown period.  
        
            Royal Wealth (Queen): Gives the player a large amount of 
            money.
            
            Sabotage (Spy): Deals a random reputation penalty to a player
            of the spy's choosing.
            
            Class Action Lawsuit (Businessman): Increases all other players'
            cooldown by two. Effect is lost once active ability is used.
            
            Power of the Mobster (Father): All players pay a sum
            to the Father.
            
            Upgrade: Allows you to upgrade your actions to increase its effectiveness. By spending money, you can upgrade
            your skill tree, with each skill costing more and more.  The upgrades
            boost a wide range of things, from the amount of money you get
            from embezzleing to the cooldown of your active ability.
    
    Once you do an action, your reputation and money will be affected accordingly.  
    After you end your turn, the next player plays their turn.
