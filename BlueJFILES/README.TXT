Objective
    The objective of the game is to win by either a money victory or 
    reputation victory, or if you are the only player left.  To win
    a money victory, you must have the highest amount of money when
    the game ends, at turn 150.  To win by reputation victory, you 
    must reach 100% reputation before turn 150.
    
Rules
    Every turn, you have to do one action. These are:
        Fundraise: Raises the amount of money in the money pit and 
        also raises your reputation by a small amount.
        
        Embezzle: Allows you to steal a set amount of money from the 
        money pit and also lowers your reputation by a moderate amount.
        
        Interact: Gives you a chance card with the effect changing your
        reputation and money.
        
        Active: Allows you to use your special ability.  Each player 
        has their own ability with a set cooldown period.  These are:
            Royal Wealth (Queen): Gives the player a large amount of 
            money.
            Sabotage (Spy): Deals a random reputation penalty to a player
            of the spy's choosing.
            Class Action Lawsuit (Businessman): Increases all other players'
            cooldown by two. Effect is lost once active ability is used.
            Power of the Mobster (Father): All players pay a maderate sum
            to the Father.
            
        Upgrade: Allows you to upgrade your skill tree.
    
    Once you do an action, your reputation and money will be affected accordingly.  
    After you end your turn, the next player plays their turn.
    
Upgrading

    Every player has their own skill tree.  By spending money, you can upgrade
    your skill tree, with each skill costing more and more.  The upgrades
    boost a wide range of things, from the amount of money you get
    from embezzleing to the cooldown of your active ability.
